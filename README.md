# SOCIAL MEDIA BUTTON TOOLTIPS

---

### Why did I re-create this?
To practice my **Vanilla CSS** skills and test if I really understand the concept of styling UI elements specifically with **"tooltips"** in this specific mini-project.

### Fun Fact:
This mini project is a re-creation (i did my own style of Vanilla CSS code btw ðŸ˜œ) of a youtube video posted by the [Coding Nepal YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingNepal). His works are wonderful btw.
